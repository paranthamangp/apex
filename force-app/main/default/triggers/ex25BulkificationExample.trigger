    //Triggers execute on batches of 200 records at a time. So if 400 records cause a trigger to fire, the trigger fires twice, once for each 200 records. 
    //For this reason, you donâ€™t get the benefit of SOQL for loop record batching in triggers, because triggers batch up records as well. 
    //The SOQL for loop is called twice in this example, but a standalone SOQL query would also be called twice. However, the SOQL for loop still looks more elegant than iterating over a collection variable!
